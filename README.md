# FeedSnap

A simple tool to help developers and website owners collect real-time feedback, bug reports, and suggestions â€” directly from their own sites.

The idea is to let users easily generate a feedback widget using an embeddable script (like Hotjar or Crisp). That script connects to a dashboard where they can see responses, manage categories (bugs, suggestions, praise), and get analytics on user inputs. We're also planning to plug in AI to summarize user feedback and auto-prioritize issues soon.

### Features
- Script generator to embed feedback widget
- Dashboard to track feedback & bug reports
- Feedback categories + status tracker
- Analytics coming soon
- Planned AI summary & prioritization

**Tech Stack:** React, Node.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, Firebase Auth, Cloudinary

**Status:** Auth & script injection working, dashboard MVP done, AI layer in progress.
